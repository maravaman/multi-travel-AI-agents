### 🧠 Smart Pattern Matching
The system uses enhanced pattern matching to route queries to the most appropriate agent:

```python
# High-Priority Pattern Matching Examples:
"I'm anxious about traveling" → TripCalmPractice
"How do I communicate with locals?" → TripCommsCoach  
"Help me decide between destinations" → TripBehaviorGuide
"I'm excited but nervous" → TripMoodDetector
"Give me a summary" → TripSummarySynth
"Plan a trip with budget" → TextTripAnalyzer
```

### 📊 Priority Scoring System
- **Exact keyword matches**: 3.0 points
- **Partial keyword matches**: 1.5 points  
- **High priority agents**: +2.0 bonus points
- **Smart defaults** for unmatched queries

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 🔄 Ultra-Fast Execution Pipeline
1. **Instant Routing** - Cached decisions for repeated patterns
2. **Threaded Execution** - Non-blocking Ollama requests
3. **Aggressive Timeouts** - 3-second max per agent
4. **Immediate Fallbacks** - Context-aware responses in <1ms
5. **Response Synthesis** - Optimized formatting and delivery

### 🛡️ Robust Fallback System
