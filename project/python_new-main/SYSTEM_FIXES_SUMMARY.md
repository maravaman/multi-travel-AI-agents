- No retry mechanism for reliability

**✅ Fixed:**
- Increased timeout to 30 seconds for generation requests
- Added 2-retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Improved connection timeout handling
- Enhanced error recovery with intelligent fallbacks

**Files Modified:**
- `core/ollama_client.py` - Updated timeout configuration
- `.env` - Optimized Ollama environment settings

### 2. **Agent Routing and Response Synthesis**

**❌ Problem:**
- Complex routing conflicts between Perfect system and LangGraph system
- Inconsistent agent selection for travel queries
- SLA violations (responses taking 30+ seconds)

**✅ Fixed:**
- Streamlined agent routing using JSON configuration
- Improved keyword-based agent selection
- Enhanced response synthesis with proper formatting
- Added performance-optimized routing with immediate fallbacks

**Files Modified:**
- `core/langgraph_multiagent_system.py` - Enhanced routing logic
- `core/agents.json` - Optimized agent configurations

### 3. **System Performance Optimization**

**❌ Problem:**
- Long response times (30+ seconds)
- SLA violations for chat mode (3s requirement)
- Inefficient fallback mechanisms

**✅ Fixed:**
- Created performance-optimized startup script
- Added immediate fallback system with 5-second timeout
- Implemented threaded Ollama requests with queue management
- Optimized logging and reduced verbosity for speed

**Files Created:**
- `start_travel_assistant_fast.py` - Performance-optimized startup
- `test_ollama_fix.py` - Comprehensive fix validation
- `test_full_integration.py` - Integration testing

## 🎯 System Architecture Improvements

### **Multi-Agent Framework Analysis**

The system uses a sophisticated LangGraph-based multi-agent architecture with:

1. **Agent Configuration (JSON-based)**:
   - RouterAgent: Query analysis and routing
   - TextTripAnalyzer: Trip planning and analysis
   - TripMoodDetector: Emotional state analysis
   - TripCommsCoach: Communication guidance
   - TripBehaviorGuide: Decision support
   - TripCalmPractice: Stress management
   - TripSummarySynth: Response synthesis

2. **Routing Logic**:
   - Keyword-based agent selection
   - Priority-weighted scoring system
   - Intelligent fallback routing
   - Context-aware agent chaining

3. **Response Synthesis**:
   - Multi-agent response combination
   - Formatted output with agent attribution
   - Execution path tracking
   - Quality indicators

### **Memory Management**

- **STM (Redis)**: Short-term session data with 30-day TTL
- **LTM (MySQL)**: Long-term persistent storage
- **Context Building**: Intelligent context aggregation from memory systems
